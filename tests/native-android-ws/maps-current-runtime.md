# Current Maps runtime work — 2026-11-12

Current V is `/Users/alex/code/v/v` (`0.5.2 f2edf66`). The new
`maps-current-guest.v` stages available boot media with selected framework and
native outputs, updating deployment input metadata from those actual files.
It uses fresh APFS clones and leaves the original media unchanged.
`maps-caller.v` disassembles selected classes across an APK's DEX files.

External work directory: `/Users/alex/.local/state/vinix/android`.
`maps-current-20261112-r1` retains the deployment-metadata refusal.
`maps-current-20261112-r2` booted with the default-network-active framework r5
and current-V native r4. The controller reached ready, then GMS exited10 with
`NoClassDefFoundError: android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice` at `djsz.<clinit>`
source398. The retained caller at
`maps-bluetooth-caller-20261112-r1/classes2.dex/djsz.smali` registers class
literals for BluetoothDevice, BluetoothClass and ParcelUuid as intent extras.

`framework_bluetooth_values.v` adds passive BluetoothDevice/BluetoothClass
parcelables and creators to normal framework generation: address validation,
value equality/hash, parcel serialization and device/service-class masks.
It exposes no radio or discovery capability. Contracts are documented in the
[BluetoothDevice](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice)
and [BluetoothClass](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothClass)
Android references.

`bluetooth-values-build.v` applied the additions to framework r5, assembled
the complete SDK and disassembled the four generated classes. Both guarded
builds passed. Final output is `framework-bluetooth-values-20261112-r2`;
its sibling log and guard JSON retain results under the original limits.
`maps-current-20261112-r3` booted that output, reached broker ready, and advanced
past both Bluetooth literals to `NoClassDefFoundError: android.os.ParcelUuid`
at `djsz.<clinit>` source430. Its serial log retains both crash traces and
controller result exports. Parcel method behavior has not yet been executed
by a dedicated regression APK. These results establish class resolution,
not full Maps functionality, search, rendering or account login.
