# Logical block volumes and storage counters

Vinix can expose up to 64 linear views of physical AHCI, NVMe and ARM VirtIO
block devices (including their partitions). A view maps a sector-aligned byte
range to `/dev/mapper/vinix0` through `/dev/mapper/vinix63`. Creating, growing or
removing a view changes kernel mappings only; it does not format the device or
move its contents. Configurations last until reboot. Boot scripts can replay
`vinix-volume create` commands against known device paths.

The native V utility is installed as `/usr/sbin/vinix-volume` by both userland
and desktop image builders. Commands require a trusted MAC domain,
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, and the initial user namespace for management; status requires
ordinary read access to the device.

```sh
# Example only: choose an unused physical extent before creating a writable view.
vinix-volume status /dev/vda
vinix-volume create /dev/vda 0 1048576 8388608
vinix-volume status /dev/mapper/vinix0
vinix-volume grow /dev/mapper/vinix0 16777216
vinix-volume remove /dev/mapper/vinix0
# A read-only view:
vinix-volume create /dev/vda 1 33554432 8388608 ro
```

Lengths and offsets are decimal bytes. Creation requires an aligned nonempty
range contained in the parent device, a free slot, and no overlap with another
managed view. Writable creation opens the parent read/write; a read-only view
can use a readable parent. Nested logical views and shrinking are unsupported.
Growing retains the start offset and can happen with raw descriptors open.
This is block capacity growth, not online filesystem resizing. The existing
filesystem registration does not dynamically discover or mount filesystems in
new views; this increment provides the block management layer.

Reconfiguration reserves the physical extent before changing geometry. It
rejects mounted/protected extents, swap, pending mounts, and active raw writes;
new overlapping writes/mounts/swap cannot enter during the change. Writable
operations and mount/swap admission recheck geometry after reserving it. This
closes the gap between sampling an old length and entering after a grow.
Protection follows the actual parent disk identity, including aliases and
whole-disk overlaps, rather than user-supplied device numbers. Filesystem
protection deliberately survives unmount while detached caches can still write.

Managed nodes and the mapper directory cannot be renamed, unlinked, hardlinked,
or used as mount targets/bind sources. Volume-backed mknod aliases can be
removed normally, but cannot acquire permanent mount pins. Path collisions
fail without replacing the existing node. Removing a volume detaches its node
and marks existing descriptors offline; subsequent I/O fails with `ENODEV`.
A reused slot gets a new generation, and old descriptors cannot remove its
replacement. Object, interface, parent and node ownership drain through the
normal VFS grace period. Metadata is charged to the creating process, including
retired objects, and dynamic policy rows are recycled with a fixed bound.

## Status ABI

`tools/volumes/volumecli/volume.h` defines the native little-endian ABI shared by
both supported 64-bit architectures. Private ioctls are:

| Request | Value | Argument |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create on a parent FD | `0x56560001` | 32-byte request, version 1, slot, offset, length, flags |
| Grow on a volume FD | `0x56560002` | Request with version 1 and new length; other fields zero |
| Remove on a volume FD | `0x56560003` | No payload |
| Query block status | `0x56560004` | 128-byte output, version 1 |

Create flags accept only bit 0 (read-only). Status has 16 `uint64_t` words:
version, bytes, logical sector size, flags, reads, writes, read bytes, write
bytes, flushes, errors, last errno, physical disk identity, physical start, slot,
generation, and reserved zero. Non-volume slot is `UINT64_MAX`. Status flags are
read-only (1), offline (2), flush supported (4), logical view (8), and counters
shared with a parent (16).

Counters describe completed backend operations/bytes and successful flushes.
Backend I/O failures increment errors and save the latest errno, including
invalid requests rejected inside a physical driver. Volume validation,
permissions and bad userspace pointers rejected before dispatch leave the
volume counters unchanged. These are request failure counters, not a hardware
diagnostic classification. A partition reports parent counters with flag 16;
a logical view tracks its own forwarded operations and inherits parent
offline/flush capability. Large
syscalls can comprise several backend operations. Health here means I/O error
and availability reporting; SMART wear, temperature, predictive failure and
real-hardware qualification remain future work. Unsupported backends return
`ENOTTY`. Geometry also supports `BLKGETSIZE64`, `BLKGETSIZE`, `BLKSSZGET`, and
`BLKROGET` without allowing destructive ioctl passthrough.

## Qualification and remaining roadmap work

`tests/storage-volumes` checks the production code on the host and ordinary
kernels on disposable ARM VirtIO and AMD64 AHCI disks. It covers bounds,
read-only policy, aliases, stale FDs/generation reuse, namespace collisions,
mount restrictions, invalid userspace pointers, CLI execution, concurrent
open/remove, physical guard sectors, active-swap exclusion and retained heap
after distinct-extent management cycles. `tests/block-storage` injects
controller completion/flush errors; `tests/mounted-disk-policy` checks
mount/write/swap interleavings.

The encompassing roadmap item stays open: persistent volume discovery,
storage pools/RAID, full-disk encryption and recovery, online filesystem resize,
TRIM/discard and controller-specific health data are not implemented by this
increment. The anonymous pager's encrypted swap remains a separate feature.
