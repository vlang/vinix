# Kernel C to V migration

Port first-party implementations in small stages, preserving their external
interfaces. Keep third-party libraries, their C headers, and independent C
test callers. Generated C from V is a build artifact, not maintained source.
Architecture instructions stay in V inline assembly where its constraints
can express the required ABI and ordering. Naked entry points with exact
fault/recovery labels stay in architecture assembly when V cannot express
their return convention without generating a C statement.

Each stage needs its subsystem tests and builds for both kernel architectures
before committing. Inspect generated C for allocations and optimized machine
code for volatile accesses or assembly ordering when these matter. Kernel
tests build in isolated worktrees to avoid incorporating concurrent changes.

The first two x86 core attempts after the runtime/CPU-helper port hit the same
free-memory accounting assertion (`tests/qemu-core/test.c:275`) seen during
the memory-runtime port. The untouched C baseline passed on rerun, and the
final migrated-kernel run passed the full core suite with four CPUs and the
native reseeding self-test enabled.

Two normal x86 retirement attempts after the diagnostics port exceeded their
300- and 900-second limits while the host load averaged about 313 across 18
logical CPUs. A previous-kernel comparison also progressed slowly through
warmup and was stopped before completion. The final run used the general
kernel regression harness with a 3600-second limit and passed the complete
workload. Its first batch kept 8 KiB of physical memory and no slab memory;
the second kept neither. The normal ARM run kept 16 then 0 KiB of physical
memory and no slab memory in either batch.

The reseeding test runs 10,000 production reseeds and partial reads, requires
zero retained objects in every heap class and zero large pages, and reaches
userspace. ARM was tested both without FEAT_RNG (native M1 virtualization)
and with it (QEMU `max` under TCG); x86 used QEMU `max` with RDSEED.
