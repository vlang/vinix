# iOS compatibility: Objective-C UIKit applications

`run-ios` loads ordinary ARM64 iOS Mach-O executables in a Vinix userspace
process. The [Objective-C UIKit calculator](../examples/ios-calculator/README.md)
now runs unchanged in a desktop window. Its original ARM64 methods perform the
arithmetic and receive UIKit target/action messages. V implements the required
Objective-C, Foundation and UIKit subset; a small assembly trampoline preserves
integer, floating-point and structure arguments during message dispatch.

[Austin Zheng's iOS-2048](../examples/ios-2048/README.md) also runs from a pinned
upstream build. Its original Objective-C sources compile without changes. The
runner loads its launch storyboard source, presents the game controller and
executes native swipe callbacks, tile merges, scoring and queued moves.

The UIKit view tree is rendered by Vinix's existing desktop compositor using
the standalone application protocol. The kernel loads the runner's static ELF
and needs no Mach-O or Darwin syscall changes. This supports the implemented apps'
API set; general iOS applications and Apple's own Calculator remain outside
the implemented subset. The existing native Vinix calculator is a separate app.

## Build and run

Build the AArch64 Alpine development sysroot with `./scripts/build-userland-aarch64.sh`
once, then:

```sh
./scripts/build-ios-aarch64.sh
./scripts/build-desktop-aarch64.sh
./scripts/run-desktop-aarch64.sh --no-build
# Open "iOS Calculator" from the desktop or Start menu.
```

The iOS builder produces the static runner, `vinix-ios-calculator` launcher,
`Calculator.app` and `Calculator.ipa` under `build/ios/`. The desktop builder
includes the runner and bundle when `build/ios/staging` exists; `VINIX_IOS_STAGING`
selects another staging directory. The launcher passes the installed Mach-O to
the runtime at `/usr/share/vinix/ios/Calculator.app/Calculator`.

Use `./scripts/build-ios-aarch64.sh --with-2048` to download, build and stage iOS-2048
as well. Open **iOS 2048**, then **Play Game**. Drag to swipe, or use arrow keys
or WASD. The `vinix-ios-2048` launcher loads
`/usr/share/vinix/ios/NumberTileGame.app/NumberTileGame`. Its bundle and IPA are
under `build/ios/2048`; the app's guide records the source revision and license.

`VINIX_IOS_BUILD_DIR`, `VINIX_AARCH64_SYSROOT`, `V` and `LLVM_BIN` select runner
build inputs/output. `IOS_CLANG`, `IOS_LD`, `IOS_SDK` and
`VINIX_IOS_CALCULATOR_BUILD_DIR` configure the app builder. An iOS SDK is optional:
the minimal declarations and linker import stubs contain no Apple implementation.
The tested build uses those declarations, Clang and `ld64.lld`.

`run-ios --inspect BINARY` reports metadata; `--imports` lists imports. The C
Mach-O probe still works with `run-ios /opt/ios/calculator 7 + 5` after staging it.
UIKit apps require the desktop's `VINIX_REQUEST_FD`/`VINIX_RESPONSE_FD` pipe pair;
executing a GUI app directly from a shell does not create a window. Set
`VINIX_IOS_TRACE=1` for UILabel update diagnostics.

## Supported ABI

| Area | Implemented |
| --- | --- |
| Images | Little-endian ARM64 `MH_EXECUTE`, `MH_PIE`, iOS/iOS Simulator platforms |
| Universal binaries | 32/64-bit slice tables, both byte orders; prefer ordinary ARM64 over ARM64e |
| Memory | Anonymous relocated image, zero-filled segment tails, segment permissions, sealed `SG_READ_ONLY` data, instruction cache flush |
| Entry point | `LC_MAIN`, `argc`/`argv`, empty null-terminated environment and Apple vectors, integer exit status |
| Dynamic linking | Chained pointer formats `DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64` and `DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64_OFFSET`, import formats 1/2/3; legacy pointer rebase/bind/lazy/weak streams, export-trie lookup, signed addends and tagged RTTI pointers; lazy slots resolved before execution |

| C++ (optional) | `--with-cxx` builds LLVM libc++ with Apple ARM64 string, 128-byte `mbstate_t` and 32-bit ctype-mask layouts; native strings, streams, regex and shared ownership tested in Vinix |
| libSystem | `_puts`, `_atoi`, `_malloc`, `_free`, `_strlen`, `_strcmp`, memory copy/move/compare/search/zero, `_strtod`, `_floorf`, unbiased `_arc4random_uniform`; Darwin ARM64 `snprintf("%.12g", double)` adapter; block ABI helpers; pthread create/join with null attributes |
| Objective-C | Class/metaclass registration, superclass dispatch, absolute/relative method lists, checked metadata, nonfragile ivar adjustment, native method execution, nil returns, allocation/new/class, retain/release/strong stores, autorelease pools, ARC destructors, zeroing weak references and copied block properties |
| Foundation | NSObject; UTF-8/constant NSString and integer/object formatting; NSNumber integers, NSIndexPath value equality, NSArray/NSMutableArray, NSMutableDictionary, fast enumeration and NSTimer callbacks |
| UIKit | UIApplicationMain/delegate launch, UIWindow, UIScreen, UIViewController presentation, nested UIView ownership/removal, UILabel, UIButton target/action, opaque UIColor, UIFont size, CALayer corner radius, single-touch swipe recognizers and simple alerts |
| Resources | XML Info.plist and bounded source storyboard subset (view/button/label, frame, color and actions), initial controller loading |
| Desktop | VAPP v10 nested view/button/label serialization, resize/layout, unique control actions, keyboard/swipe input, timer polling, window close and object teardown |
| Inspection | Platform/version, dependencies, unsupported metadata, chained and legacy symbol-table import names, including ARM64e images |

Header, command and segment ranges are checked before loading. Chained pointers
are checked against their file-backed segment and page before any memory is
rewritten. Every import is resolved before any chain is rewritten. Gaps
are inaccessible and no segment is writable and executable together. The
runner releases its mapping on return or link failure and exits after one app.

ARM64e/PAC, encrypted images, non-PIE binaries, custom stack sizes, threaded dyld
binding opcodes, TLS pointer/initializer sections and multiple chain starts
per page are rejected. Objective-C categories, +load/+initialize, exceptions,
Swift metadata are unsupported. Blocks support object/block captures, but not
`__block` by-reference captures. The runtime and weak tables are single-threaded.
Mach services,
direct Darwin syscalls, dynamic framework loading, Swift/SwiftUI, general
Foundation/UIKit APIs, scenes, compiled nibs/storyboards and Auto Layout are not
implemented. View trees have bounded depth and at most 64 children per view.
UIView animations execute their blocks/completions synchronously; only their
final states are drawn, without sliding/pop interpolation or layer transforms.

Unknown strong imports and unknown methods fail with a specific diagnostic.
General Darwin variadic calls such as `_printf` cannot be forwarded to musl.
The calculator's `snprintf` double format and NSString's supported substitutions
have calling-convention adapters.
UIKit typography/fit-to-width is approximate and UIKit accessibility labels
are accepted but not exposed through a Vinix accessibility service.

## Official PPSSPP iOS binary probe

[PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/download/) is a substantial open-source PSP
emulator with a publicly downloadable iOS IPA. The pinned
[official 1.20.4 release](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/releases/tag/v1.20.4)
requires no App Store authentication. Its executable and resources are downloaded
into the ignored build directory, without modifying or vendoring app code:

```sh
python3 examples/ios-ppsspp/download.py
v -enable-globals -cc clang -gc none \
  -cflags '-fsanitize=address,undefined' -ldflags '-fsanitize=address,undefined' \
  -path "@vlib|$PWD/compat/ios|@vmodules" \
  -o build/ios/run-ios-ppsspp-host compat/ios/runner
build/ios/run-ios-ppsspp-host --imports \
  build/ios/ppsspp/unpacked/Payload/PPSSPP.app/PPSSPP
build/ios/run-ios-ppsspp-host \
  build/ios/ppsspp/unpacked/Payload/PPSSPP.app/PPSSPP

# Inspect and attempt the identical executable in a real Vinix ARM64 guest:
./scripts/build-ios-aarch64.sh
python3 tests/ios/run.py --no-build --with-ppsspp
```

The downloader verifies the release's 31,124,277-byte IPA against the publisher's
SHA-256, checks extraction paths and verifies the unpacked executable:

```text
IPA:        822c7042311ff47710c9148c8edb5aab649cf85ce6ba96b9e8190feb91f45a51
Executable: 7c9456c3cdee44dc48eefde5454bffa7e0965a32aa32858a181a06fbffeacf6c
Bundle:     org.ppsspp.ppsspp, version 1.20.4, minimum iOS 11.0
```

The 2026-10-06 probe found an unencrypted ordinary ARM64 Mach-O, 27 dependencies
and 767 imports. The import names match LLVM's independent symbol-table listing.
The largest groups are:

| Dependency | Imports |
| --- | ---: |
| libSystem | 304 |
| libc++ | 187 |
| OpenGL ES | 99 |
| UIKit | 29 |
| Objective-C runtime | 26 |

**PPSSPP does not launch on Vinix yet.** Both the host runner and the Vinix guest
reject it before its entry point with exit status 1. The executable requires
libSystem APIs and graphics/audio frameworks beyond the
current subset, including OpenGL ES, Metal and AudioToolbox. The bundle contains
an additional MoltenVK dylib. No app UI or emulation was reached.

The guest regression explicitly prints `iOS BLOCKED: upstream PPSSPP rejected
before entry point` after verifying the import count and rejection. Passing this
regression verifies inspection and the rejection diagnostic, rather than app
compatibility. `--with-2048` can be combined with `--with-ppsspp` to exercise the
working app in the same guest. Host inspection/attempts also run under ASan/UBSan.

Binaries without chained fixups previously reported no imports. `--imports` reads
bounded `LC_SYMTAB`/`nlist_64` records, filters defined/debug/local/common symbols,
resolves library ordinals and preserves weak-reference flags.

The legacy loader now validates all **50,782 relocation writes** in this exact
PPSSPP binary, including lazy slots, weak coalescing, backwards address advances
and tagged RTTI names. Initializers, terminators and Darwin TLS also execute in
Vinix: a native iOS fixture checks initialized/zero-filled TLS across eight
threads and runs a registered destructor after returning from `main`.

The optional C++ build provides all 187 C++ symbols imported by PPSSPP. It uses
pinned, SHA-256-verified LLVM/Alpine sources and archives, without copying Apple
library implementations. The following regression executes native iOS C++
constructors, string growth/erase, stream insertion/extraction, regex matching,
shared ownership and destructors in the same Vinix guest as calculator/2048:

```sh
python3 tests/ios/run.py --with-cxx --with-2048 --with-ppsspp
# Independently validate PPSSPP's actual linker streams without executing it:
VINIX_IOS_PPSSPP_BINARY="$PWD/build/ios/ppsspp/unpacked/Payload/PPSSPP.app/PPSSPP" \
  v -enable-globals -gc none test compat/ios/macho
```

`./scripts/build-ios-aarch64.sh --with-cxx` enables this library in the runner.
The C++ fixture uses Apple's public C++ headers from `IOS_SDK` or the available
command-line-tools SDK, compiles for **arm64-apple-ios15.0**, and links only the
repository's import stubs. The library is rebuilt for Vinix with musl. C++
exception unwinding through Mach-O frames and Darwin pthread mutex/condition
layouts remain unsupported; this is a tested C++ subset, not a complete ABI.

**These changes do not make PPSSPP launch yet.** The remaining rejection is for
unimplemented frameworks/libraries, rather than legacy linking, initializers or
TLS. PPSSPP still needs its GLKit/EAGL rendering and UIKit scene lifecycle,
additional Foundation and Darwin libSystem APIs, plus audio and device services.
The PPSSPP guest marker continues to report this failure explicitly. No PPSSPP
menu or PSP game has been run.

## Local Apple Calculator inspection

On 2026-10-05 this Mac has macOS 26.5 (25F71), command-line developer tools,
and no installed iOS Simulator runtime. The available application is:

```text
/System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator
com.apple.calculator, version 12.0, build 225
CFBundleSupportedPlatforms: MacOSX
SHA-256: f11151e63f888232772e5e4319635fc847aea5419e5849d723a10281e69e5c42
```

Its universal slices are x86_64 and ARM64e. The ARM64e image targets macOS
26.5, uses chained fixups and has 2,059 chained imports. The largest dependency
groups are SwiftUI (955), Swift core (306), the private Calculate framework
(213), Foundation (184), and AppIntents (85). It also imports CalculateUI,
AppKit, SwiftData, libobjc's `_objc_msgSend`/`_objc_msgSendSuper2`, dispatch and
Swift concurrency. Matching the CPU architecture or implementing integer
arithmetic cannot satisfy those ABIs.

Reproduce the inspection with the V reader (no Apple binary is copied into
the repository):

```sh
mkdir -p build/ios
v -enable-globals -cc clang -gc none -path "@vlib|$PWD/compat/ios|@vmodules" \
  -o build/ios/run-ios-host compat/ios/runner
build/ios/run-ios-host --imports \
  /System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator
```

To continue toward Apple's **iOS** Calculator, obtain its unencrypted ARM64
developer/simulator executable and resources, then inspect the actual import
set with `--imports`. That determines the required Objective-C/Swift runtime,
Foundation/Calculate API and UIKit or SwiftUI implementation. A Vinix UI bridge
must then render its views and deliver input through the compositor. The local
macOS app's import list is evidence about that app, not a substitute for the
missing iOS executable.

## Validation and format references

```sh
VMODULES="$PWD/compat/ios" v -enable-globals -cc clang test compat/ios
./tests/ios/run-objc-calculator.sh
python3 tests/ios/uikit.py # after building build/ios/run-ios-host above
python3 tests/ios/run.py
python3 tests/ios/desktop.py --desktop build/vinix-desktop
# Upstream iOS-2048, including original model tests and real guest swipes:
./tests/ios/build-2048-model.sh # after building the app
build/ios/run-ios-host build/ios/2048/model-tests
python3 tests/ios/game2048.py
python3 tests/ios/run.py --with-2048
python3 tests/ios/desktop.py --app 2048 --desktop build/vinix-desktop
```

Host tests cover malformed file/command/section/segment/chain ranges, universal
byte orders, relocation, import addends, unsupported features and libSystem
semantics. The Vinix guest executes addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and remainder, checks zero-filled data, exercises heap/string calls,
checks error/exit propagation, selects ARM64 from a universal executable, and
rejects missing imports, ARM64e and truncated images. Both the host protocol
client and Vinix guest exercise the unchanged UIKit Mach-O through all 27
calculator cases, resize, keyboard input, 1,000 update cycles and complete ARC
object teardown. ASan/UBSan checks the host runtime as well as the model.
The desktop test boots a minimal isolated image, clicks 7, +, 5, = through QEMU's
virtual pointer, checks the resulting UILabel update and saves
`build/ios/calculator.ppm`. It needs a desktop binary built with the new launcher.
The VM tests reuse the kernel and use disposable boot/package/persistent disks;
`run.py --no-build` reuses the runner, and `--timeout=SECONDS` sets the deadline.

The independently written parser follows Apple's public
[Mach-O load command definitions](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h)
and [dyld chained fixup definitions](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/dyld/blob/main/include/mach-o/fixup-chains.h).
No Apple implementation or proprietary app bytes are vendored.

The runtime follows the published [Objective-C metadata layout](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/objc4/blob/main/runtime/objc-runtime-new.h)
and [Apple ARM64 calling conventions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms).
Framework behavior here is independently implemented in V, without copying
Apple runtime or framework implementations.
